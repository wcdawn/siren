I tried to see if I could recreate the "transport ratio" curve using MC**2 data.
The short answer is "no."
While the results look reasonable at hight energy, they are totally useless at low energy.

My hypothesis is that using some sort of a code like NJOY or FRENDY would be necessary to generate the requisite data for such an investigation
